** for better output I should still parse the entire buffer,
*** and only log the specified region
*** command could send the line nums













* program steps:
** take file
** remove crlf
** remove everything below #else
*** I can do an elisp batch operation to put the EDIT_CONST everywhere
**

* checkout more examples and find things


* TODO attribute for custom value types (make nullable)
** custom structs lookup
* skeletton dll with common types ->
** num
** frozen collections

* frozen collections patches special stuff
 [[file:~/org/rewriter/collectionconst.cs::#else][example]]

* generic: default to referenceType,

* everything defaults to referenceType with backing field,


* move the const rewriter + tests into its own repo
** sharpel just has a reference to it.
